-The above picture is an example of a 16x1 multiplexer which can be constructed using 4 4x1 multiplexers.
-When trying to code or run this multiplexer, we need to see what's going on a plus what's happening first. 

-Inputs: I0, I1, I2, I3, I4, I5, I6, I7, I8, I9, I10, I11, I12, I13, I14, I15
-Selects: S0, S1, S2, S3
-Output: F

-All 4 bottom multiplexers have selects: S0 and S1 and the top multiplexer has selects: S2 and S3
- HHH
