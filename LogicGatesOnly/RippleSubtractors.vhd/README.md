Nothing much really to say here to be honest. The structure of the ripple subtractor diagram is precisely the exact same as the structure of the ripple adder diagram except one key change: There's a not diagram in one of the inputs which is B.

In a ripple adder, 2 inputs at the top of each adder of the 4 combined adders joined together making a ripple adder join the adders. But for the ripple subtractor, there's a not gate for input B meaning one of the inputs for each adder of all 4 adders is (not B) then.
